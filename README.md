<h2>System Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>User Authentication:</strong> Supports two roles — 
    <em>Admins</em> (penetration testers who run campaigns) and 
    <em>Managers</em> (organization security leads who monitor results).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Campaign Management:</strong> Admins can add target emails, and launch simulated phishing attacks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Email Testing Environment:</strong> Uses Mailtrap as a sandbox SMTP
    server to safely test email delivery and behavior without sending real emails.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Attack Flow Visualization:</strong> Shows how a phishing attack is
    executed end‑to‑end — from sending the email to link clicks and login attempts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dashboard & Tracking:</strong> Tracks which targets clicked the link
    or submitted login information. All events are logged into the SQL Server
    database for reporting and analysis.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Simple GUI:</strong> Easy‑to‑use interface demonstrating the basics
    of phishing simulation and social engineering awareness.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This project is a student‑built tool focused on understanding phishing workflows.
